# HackMIT-2021
We aim to provide a simple and easy to use platform for users to obtain structures of straight chain hydrocarbons in just 1 click!


Inspiration
Hydrocarbons form the basic structure of all life forms and thatâ€™s why it is the basic building block for all the fields related to organic chemistry. In order to study the various reactions involved with hydrocarbons, one should be clear with their structures. Now, it is not possible for anyone to memorize the structure of all the possible hydrocarbons. Therefore, we have come up with an efficient program that can develop a real graphic-based structure of a hydrocarbon-based on its IUPAC name.

This project only works on Turbo C++, and no other IDE.
This is because the graphics.h file does not work with any other application!
